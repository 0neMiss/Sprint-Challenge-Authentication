# Pushing you Onward with your knowledge of Authentication.

* **DISCLAIMER** Authentication is a subject that many people spend a large amount of their careers learning about. This is not something we expect you to have a mastery over, rather, we're preparing you to be able have an intelligent.

* The objective of this challenge is to get you used to answering a few questions about Authentication.
* We also have some more reps for you to help hammer in the knowledge you've thus far learned.
* Answers to your written questions will be recorded in _Answers.md_
* This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can _reference_ any old code you may have, and the React Documentation, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something.
* **Just a friendly Reminder** Don't fret or get anxious about this, this is a no-pressure assessment that is only going to help guide you here in the near future. This is NOT a pass/fail situation.

## Start by forking and cloning this repository.

## Questions - Self Study - You can exercise your Google-Fu for this and any other _Sprint Challenge_ in the future.

1. Describe Middleware, Sessions (as we know them in express), bcrypt and JWT.
1. What does bcrypt do in order to prevent attacks?
1. What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?

## Project - User Management System

* What we have here is a wise-guy application. _Dad jokes_ are all the rage these days.
* Our main problem with the application now is that we are trying to receive some mad dad jokes that are being requested from an external api, but we are locked out.
* Trust me, we all need these dad jokes in our lives.
* In order to be able to access our Killer Jokes you'll need to implement a User Authentication System that uses bcrypt and JWT.

## Initializing the Project

```
{
    "name": "JsonWebTokenError",
    "message": "invalid signature"
}
